// 1. Create a temperature variable (celcius) and store a value to it (make up a value to start)
let temp = 20;

// 2. Select the `#temp` element in the document and store a reference to it
let eleTemp = document.getElementById(`temp`);

// 3. Assign the temperature variable to the #temp as innerHTML

// 4. Select the `#app` element in the document and store a reference to it

// 5. Change the background colour of the #app to reflect the temperature's value visually:
//      If the temp is greater than 0, set a `tomato` background
//      If the temp is less than or equal to 0, set a `dodgerblue` background



//      If the temp is exactly 0, set a `lightgrey` background

// 6. Modify the application to change the amount of red/blue relative to the amount of hot/cold (take home!)
//      HINT: convert the hot and cold numbers to RGB. Remember, each channel is a number from 0 to 255 (which is somewhat close to 10x the average summer high!)
