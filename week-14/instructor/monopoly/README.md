# Game

In groups of 4, choose any card or board game that is familiar to all members.

## Week 14:

### SETUP
- One member: 
    - Create a Github Organization (use the game name or similar)
    - Invite all members as "collaborators" to the organization
    - Add a repo with the organiation name + .github.io
        Example: For an orgnization called *monopolygame*. Repo name: `monopolygame.github.io`
    - Setup a project folder in the repo with `index.html` and all the required files
    - Add the file `README.md` to the folder
- All members:
    - Clone the repository    

### SCOPING: Data & Functionality
- As a team:
    1. Create the data variables (arrays and objects) required to hold the information needed to play the game. Add the variables to your js file.
    2. Write out the functions needed throught the game in order for it to play. For each, briefly describe what it does, as well as any input arguments or return values.


## Week 15:

### INTERFACE
- Design and build the interface. Work together to each member a task. For each member's task, branch from `master` with an appropriate name and get to work.
- Assign appropriate `id` values for the interactive components (will read input or action from a user, or will be used to output)

### INTERACTION
- Determine the actions needed to play the game: start, take turns, end, etc.
- Assign listeners that will run the appropriate functions needed to play.
